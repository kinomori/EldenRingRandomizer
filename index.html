            To start, pick a difficulty from the above list. Then click the dice button to roll your build. The list of weapons will be what you're allowed to use in your left and right hand. The passives are meant to be followed for the entire run. The most important part is to have fun, so don't feel afraid to add extra difficulty, or even lighten the difficulty more. <br><br>If you roll a class that doesn't start with any of the weapons you were given, look up where to get one of those weapons and make an effort to get that weapon ASAP.
